# coilCAM
CoilCAM is a visual scripting plug-in for Rhinoâ€™s Grasshopper. It enables the use of mathematically-defined toolpaths in the generation of parametric forms and surface textures for 3D-printing ceramics. See the [User Guide for more info.](https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/coilCAM)

## Requirements
Currently this library works only with Rhino 7 on both Mac and PC.

(optional) In order to use the audioInterp object, you must have Python2 installed on your machine with the NumPy and SciPy libraries. See PythonRemote setup object for more information.

## Installation
1. Open Grasshopper
2. File > Special Folders > User Objects Folder to open the hidden user objects folder 
3. Copy the user object (.ghuser) files from the CoilCAM user objects folder into the Grasshopper user objects folder

The CoilCAM user objects should now appear in the Grasshopper toolbar. 

More Info about the project can be found [here](https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/publication/coilcam).
